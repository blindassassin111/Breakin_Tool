# Breakin_Tool
Tool to breakin switches inspired by the one seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkM8NjMfSCg

Uses the same motor as shown in his description. https://www.banggood.com/Machifit-GA12N20-M4100-6V-60RPM12V-200RPM-DC-Speed-Reduction-Gear-Motor-N20-Motor-p-1341687.html?p=PW280230661165201902&cur_warehouse=CN&ID=513675

Install cams rotated 90 degrees from the last one (should have two in each direction)

You need at least 8 nuts (end spacers only need 1 nut each): https://www.mcmaster.com/90695A035/

Print list:
- 2x End Caps
- 8x Switch Clips
- 4x Cams
- 2x End Spacers
- 3x Mid Spacers

Cam lift is only 3.5mm to allow it to be used on switches that bottom out earlier. If you need a bit less you can not put the clips on as far.

REQUIRES DSA KEYCAPS TO OPERATE!!!
